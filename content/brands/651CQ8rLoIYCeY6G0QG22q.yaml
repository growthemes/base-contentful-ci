companyDescription: Normann Copenhagen is a way of living - a mindset. We love to challenge the conventional design rules. This is why you will find traditional materials put into untraditional use such as a Stone Hook made of Icelandic stones, a vase made out of silicon and last but not least a dog made out of plastic.
